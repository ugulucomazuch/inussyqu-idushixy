Winner of five 2024 Tony Awards, including Best Play
 An epic play with music that examines the human costs of the quest for artistic greatness. The place: Sausalito. The time: the mid-1970s. The carpet: brown shag.¬†Stereophonic¬†brings us inside the cloistered world of a recording studio as a rock band on the brink of superstardom attempts to create their sophomore album. The ensuing pressures open up cracks in the band‚Äôs once-easy camaraderie, and spats over issues like tempo and song length begin to reveal deeper problems in the band‚Äôs foundation. Running on a diet of booze, sleep deprivation, and a giant bag of cocaine, interpersonal relationships are pushed to the breaking point as a process that was meant to last a few weeks becomes a neverending slog. With original songs by Arcade Fire‚Äôs Will Butler,¬†David Adjmi‚Äôs play is an electrifying portrait of a band wracked with division and disillusionment that nevertheless might be on the verge of creating a masterpiece.
