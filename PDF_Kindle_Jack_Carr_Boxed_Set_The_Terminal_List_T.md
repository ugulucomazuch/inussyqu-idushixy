A white-knuckled boxed set featuring the first three “absolutely awesome” (Brad Thor, #1 New York Times bestselling author) thrillers in the instant #1 New York Times bestselling Terminal List series, coming to Amazon Prime.

 In The Terminal List, we’re introduced to James Reece, a Navy SEAL with nothing left to lose when he discovers that the very government he has spent his career working for was behind the deaths of his teammates in Afghanistan. He embarks on an “intense” (Chuck Norris) journey for vengeance that will have you glued to your seat until the final page.

 Now a wanted terrorist in True Believer, Reece is the only one who can help the United States government track down and take out a dangerous Iraqi commando. But Reece may have bit off more than he can chew when he uncovers a global conspiracy of deadly proportions.

 Finally, in this “badass, high velocity round of reading” (Marc Cameron, New York Times bestselling author), Savage Son follows Reece as he recovers in the Montana wilderness, unaware that the Russian mafia has him in their crosshairs.

 “Explosive and riveting” (Kevin Maurer, coauthor of No Easy Day), this boxed set is a must-have for any fan of Brad Thor and Vince Flynn.
