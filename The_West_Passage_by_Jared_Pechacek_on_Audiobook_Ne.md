Overview
THE LADIES REIGN. THE PALACE ROTS. THE BEAST RISES. “The West Passage is a dangerous book of secrets.” —Travis Baldree, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Legends &amp; Lattes “A weird and wonderful tale, rich with imagination and utterly unique.” —Sunyi Dean, author of The Book Eaters “One of the finest fantasies of this decade, a sweeping swarm of fiercely human creativity.” —Indrapramit Das, author of The Devourers When the Guardian of the West Passage died in her bed, the women of Grey Tower fed her to the crows and went back to their chores. No successor was named as Guardian, no one took up the fallen blade; the West Passage went unguarded. Now, snow blankets Grey in the height of summer, foretelling the coming of the Beast. The too-young Mother of Grey House and the Guardian&#039;s unnamed squire set out to save their people. Their narrow shoulders bear a heavy burden. Before them lies the West Passage, home to horrors and delights that defy imagining. None can say if they&#039;ll reach their destinations, but one thing is for sure: the world is about to change.
