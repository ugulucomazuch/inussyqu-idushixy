Everyone knows DAISY JONES &amp; THE SIX, but nobody knows the reason behind their split at the absolute height of their popularity . . . until now.

Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it‚Äôs the rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll she loves most. By the time she‚Äôs twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.

 Also getting noticed is The Six, a band led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she‚Äôs pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.

 Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes that the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend.

 The making of that legend is chronicled in this riveting and unforgettable novel, written as an oral history of one of the biggest bands of the seventies. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a talented writer who takes her work to a new level with Daisy Jones &amp; The Six, brilliantly capturing a place and time in an utterly distinctive voice.
