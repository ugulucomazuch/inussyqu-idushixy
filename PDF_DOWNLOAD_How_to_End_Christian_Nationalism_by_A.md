Overview
&quot;A potent tool for taking action.&quot; â€”JEMAR TISBY &quot;Read this book and take its lessons to heart.&quot; â€”KRISTIN KOBES DU MEZ &quot;An indispensable tool in renewing civic engagement and democracy.&quot; â€”ANTHEA BUTLER &quot;Timely and insightful.&quot; â€”ROBERT P. JONES The essential guidebook for Christians alarmed by the rising tide of Christian nationalism yet unsure how to counter it. Christian nationalism is a powerful and pervasive ideology, and it is becoming normalized. From Amanda Tyler, lead organizer of the Christians Against Christian Nationalism campaign, comes How to End Christian Nationalism, your vital companion for countering this dangerous ideology. Tyler draws on her experiences, conversations with pastors and laypeople, research, Scripture, her Baptist convictions, and her work as a constitutional law expert to help us confront Christian nationalist fervor. You&#039;ll learn how to distinguish Christian nationalism from the teachings of Jesus and to demonstrate how the former perpetuates white supremacy. This book also unpacks key truths we can share with others: Patriotism is not the same as nationalism. Religious freedom means little if it&#039;s not for everyone. Christians follow a gospel of love, not the idol of power. Here, you&#039;ll find stories of what Christians are doing to resist Christian nationalism in their churches and communities, plus ideas for your own work. From strategies for faith-rooted organizing to guidance for holding hard conversations with loved ones, Tyler offers practical ways to protect faith freedom for all. With precision and compassion, Tyler offers cogent arguments for the separation of church and state, a timely call to action, and an urgent case for replacing a twisted, fearful version of faith with one that is good and right and true. We&#039;ve all seen what Christian nationalism can do. Now is the time for Christians to reckon with its harm. Now is the time to end it.
