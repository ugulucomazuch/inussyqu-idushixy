Notes From Your Bookseller Game of Thrones meets Vikings, for fans of ancient magic, fierce warriors and bloody battles. The Fury of the Gods is the earth-shattering final book in John Gwynne&amp;#039;s bestselling Norse-inspired epic fantasy series, packed with myth, magic and bloody vengeance. 
 The final battle for the fate of Vigrid approaches... Varg has overcome the trials of his past and become an accepted member of the Bloodsworn, but now he and his newfound comrades face their biggest challenge yet: slaying a dragon.
 
 Elvar is struggling to consolidate her power in Snakavik, where she faces threats from without and within. As she fights to assert her authority in readiness for the coming conflict, she faces a surely insurmountable task: reigning in the ferocity of a wolf god.
 
 As BiÃ³rr and his warband make their way north, eager for blood, GuÃ°varr pursues a mission of his own, hoping to win Lik-Rifaâ€™s favor and further his own ambitions.
 
 All paths lead to Snakavik, where the lines are being drawn for the final battleâ€”a titanic clash that will shake the foundations of the world and bear witness to the true fury of the gods. Â
